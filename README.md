***

The executable files found in this repository were made using PyInstaller on the latest version of [Obfuskey](https://github.com/bujojo16/obfuskey). They are meant as a user-friendly way of running Obfuskey for user who don't want to bother installing Python 3.11. It is recommended to read the documentation located in the Obfuskey repository before running any of the executables in here.

## How to use
- Download the ZIP file of the repository and UNZIP it in a folder 
    or
- clone the repository

You will need to keep the file structure to run Obfuskey, meaning the Mnemonics directory must be in the same directory as the executable. If you need to add another mnemonic, add it to the Mnemonics directory.

The output of the obfuscation will be a text file found in the "Output" directory, created by the program.
